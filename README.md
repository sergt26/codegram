# code</>gram

This is a website template/feature rails app that was built as a 'mid-term' project during our time attending Wyncode Academy. The idea is that you can upload an image of your working app and link your github repo URL for the working code. We saw it as a way to motivate others to start or finish their own projects. 

## Getting Started

Assuming that you have rails installed. Fork the repo. Run: `rails db:migrate` in your terminal. Run: `bundle install`. This will get your app ready to start the server. `rails s` will get the server going. 

Go to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) on your browser of choice to see the app running. From here you are free to Signup and create posts. Have fun!
